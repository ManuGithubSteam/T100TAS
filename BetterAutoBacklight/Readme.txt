This auto-brightness script is a modification of the orginal script.

All credit goes there and to Stefan for getting the new features in!

Features:

Better light adjustment, only 80 % at normal room so there is some light left for the sunny balcony :-)

You can make manual changes and the script will honor them. To reactivate the script set the backlight to the absolute minimum.
